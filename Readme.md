## Evaluation Platform for collecting user direct ratings

The LLM generated responses are rendered as markdown saved as pdf files. 

You can find them in folder **./tasks/**

For the evaluation, each participant will be assigned LLM-generated descriptions of the same Petri nets, 
so that they can compare.
